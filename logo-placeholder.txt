# Logo Placeholder

Place your logo image here as: logo.png

Recommended specifications:
- Format: PNG (with transparent background preferred)
- Size: 120x120 pixels minimum (will be displayed at 40px height)
- Should work well on dark backgrounds
- Can also use JPG if transparency is not needed

The logo will appear in the top-left corner of the navigation bar.

To add your logo:
1. Save your logo image as "logo.png" in this directory
2. Delete this placeholder file
3. Refresh your website to see the logo

If the logo.png file is missing, the text "Antonuccio Family" will still display correctly.
